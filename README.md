# CNN BASED CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM FOR COVID-19 VACCINE RELATED TWEETS
BERT-CNN and XLnet-CNN 

## Intro
In this paper, the Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNet) have been integrated to build an efficient and automated classification system for the Covid-19 vaccine-related tweets. The system can help to get the most relevant information about the people's opinions related to the vaccine. Several experiments using manually annotated 15,000 tweets about the vaccine have been conducted, and it has been observed that the developed system has the ability to obtain quite good performance.
